Project Title: Bulldog Mailroom Notification System

# Project Description
This Project was written using Java programming language, and more specifically JavaFX and the Java Mail Application Programming Interface package. 
Our notification system has been set up to notify Fisk University students when their parcels and mail arrive in the mailroom.
This program is intended to function as an Administrative Desktop App that allows the Mailroom Manager to alert Fisk University Students of Package Arrival.
The project has an authentication login page which will be used by the Mailroom Manager.
It is also equipped with a tentative database of Fisk University students information, such as full names and email addresses, which will be used as the means for notification.
There is also a working active functionality to add more students, who are not presently saved in the system, to the database.
When the Mailroom Manager enters the student's name and package details, our system immediately notifies the said student about the arrival of their package and its details.


# How to Run
1. First, compile and run the createCSV.java file to create an existing student database
2. Compile and run the BulldogMailroomEmailingSystem.java file to run the application.
